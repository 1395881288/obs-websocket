## Downloads
Binaries for Windows and Linux are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases) section.

## Using obs-websocket
A web client and frontend made by [t2t2](https://github.com/t2t2/obs-tablet-remote) (compatible with tablets and other touch interfaces) is available here : http://t2t2.github.io/obs-tablet-remote/

It is **highly recommended** to protect obs-websocket with a password against unauthorized control. To do this, open the "Websocket server settings" dialog under OBS' "Tools" menu. In the settings dialogs, you can enable or disable authentication and set a password for it.

### Possible use cases
- Remote control OBS from a phone or tablet on the same local network
- Change your stream overlay/graphics based on the current scene (like the AGDQ overlay does)
- Automate scene switching with a third-party program (e.g. : auto-pilot, foot pedal, ...)

### For developers
The server is a typical Websockets server running by default on port 4444 (the port number can be changed in the Settings dialog). 
The protocol understood by the server is documented in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).
